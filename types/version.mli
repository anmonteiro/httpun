(** Protocol Version

    HTTP uses a "<major>.<minor>" numbering scheme to indicate versions of the
    protocol. The protocol version as a whole indicates the sender's conformance
    with the set of requirements laid out in that version's corresponding
    specification of HTTP.

    See {{:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-2.6} RFC7230ยง2.6} for
    more details. *)
