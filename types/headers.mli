(** Header Fields

    Each header field consists of a case-insensitive {b field name} and a {b
    field value}. The order in which header fields {i with differing field
    names} are received is not significant. However, it is good practice to
    send header fields that contain control data first so that implementations
    can decide when not to handle a message as early as possible.

    A sender MUST NOT generate multiple header fields with the same field name
    in a message unless either the entire field value for that header field is
    defined as a comma-separated list or the header field is a well-known
    exception, e.g., [Set-Cookie].

    A recipient MAY combine multiple header fields with the same field name
    into one "field-name: field-value" pair, without changing the semantics of
    the message, by appending each subsequent field value to the combined field
    value in order, separated by a comma. {i The order in which header fields
    with the same field name are received is therefore significant to the
    interpretation of the combined field value}; a proxy MUST NOT change the
    order of these field values when forwarding a message.

    {i Note.} Unless otherwise specified, all operations preserve header field
    order and all reference to equality on names is assumed to be
    case-insensitive.

    See {{:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2} RFC7230ยง3.2} for
    more details. *)
